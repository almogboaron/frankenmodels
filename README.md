- [X] **Analyze the Current Results:**
  - [X] Review the CSV file to identify which layer duplications improve metrics over the base model.
  - [X] Compare improvements in accuracy, F1, precision, and recall.
  - [X] Note any layers that consistently show performance gains (e.g., layer 6 in your outputs).

- [X] **Validate Improvements:**
  - [X] Run multiple experiments with different random seeds to ensure statistical significance.
  - [X] Check for consistency in the improvements across runs.

- [ ] **Evaluate Trade-Offs:**
  - [ ] Measure changes in model size, inference speed, and memory usage with each duplication.
  - [ ] Determine if the performance gains justify the increased computational cost.

- [ ] **Expand Your Experiments:**
  - [ ] Test duplicating the same layer multiple times (e.g., duplicating layer 6 twice or three times).
  - [ ] Explore duplicating combinations of layers (e.g., duplicating both layers 6 and 7).
  - [ ] Consider applying the approach to different model architectures (e.g., BERT large or RoBERTa).

- [ ] **Enhance Visualization and Reporting:**
  - [ ] Create additional visualizations (line plots, heatmaps) to show trends and differences from the base model.
  - [ ] Document your experimental setup, methodology, results, and insights in a detailed report or research paper.

- [ ] **Further Hypothesis Testing:**
  - [ ] Perform ablation studies to see how layer duplications affect performance on specific subsets of data (e.g., easy vs. hard examples).
  - [ ] Analyze if certain duplications help more in specific scenarios.

- [ ] **Community and Literature Review:**
  - [ ] Search for related work using keywords like "duplicating frozen layers", "free lunch neural networks", or "model replication."
  - [ ] Compare your results with findings from recent preprints or blog posts.
  - [ ] Share your results on forums (e.g., r/MachineLearning) or GitHub for feedback.

This checklist should guide you through the next steps in your research to thoroughly evaluate the impact of layer duplication on your Frankenmodel's performance.
